APB RAM Design and Verification
Overview
This project focuses on the design and verification of an APB-interfaced RAM module, using SystemVerilog and simulated on EDA Playground. The design adheres to the AMBA APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) protocol and demonstrates read and write operations with a configurable memory.

Key Features
📦 APB-compliant RAM with parameterizable address and data width

🔁 Supports read/write operations through standard APB signals

🧪 SystemVerilog Testbench with self-checking mechanisms

🛠️ Developed and simulated entirely on EDA Playground

🔍 Protocol assertions for verifying correct APB behavior

📈 Visual waveforms with GTKWave (via EDA Playground)
